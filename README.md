# work-from-home-setup

So, here is my current list of things I would recommend for people for working from home for meetings. It is a combination of Headphones, Mic, Lighting, and Camera. The major thing is Audio, and everything else is a bonus on top of that. I am not saying you should go out and spend a bunch of money, but anything over the built in stuff is a big upgrade to make your meeting more enjoyable.

## Headset 
First things first... the best thing you can do is just get a headset. Literally any USB headset that is like $20 will work and they are also great if you don't have a full desk. This is a huge improvementand is my first recommendation.

## Upgrading
Want to go further and do some more serious upgrades and look a bit more like:

Here are a bunch of recommendations to help get your there regardless of your budget:

## Microphone:
Good audio is important!
### All in one 
Advantage... all in one, USB, nothing else needed, but more limiting.

* Blue Yeti Nano - $100 - https://amzn.to/395En9c
* Blue Yeti - $130 - https://amzn.to/2woFSlp
* Blue Yeti Pro - $170 - https://amzn.to/3a8vP5D

With any of these I highly recommend that they have a place where it can be really close to them or an Arm Mount is great and some of these have combos. 

### USB + ARM == Awesome
One of my new favorite products is the [Yeticaster](https://amzn.to/2JgIrsB), which has a built in Yeti + Arm in it! For $180 it is a steal and you don't have to worry about a complex setup and you can get it close to your mouth for the best audio.

### Stand alone Mics
I am a big fan of combining Mic + Arm + XLR + Audio interface. You get all of the control and have a wide variety of options. There are a lot of mics out there, however the main ones that we use for podcasting are the MXL 770 and the Blue Blackout SL. These both are solid microphones. They are a bit different in price, but you can't go wrong with either.

* MXL 770 - $70 - https://amzn.to/2QAfLyV
* Top Pick - Blue Blackout SL - $200 - https://amzn.to/2x9obGH

#### These also need an audio interface
These give you complete control from XLR to USB with the ability to adjust your audio levels, mix, and more.

* U-Phoria UMC22 - $70 - https://amzn.to/2IZMWHZ
* Scarlett Solo - $100 - https://amzn.to/2KbVVcS
* Also you will need a XLR cable
* Amazon Basics - < $10 - https://amzn.to/2x99dAu

### Microphone Arm Mount - Recommended
* Cheap - NEEWER Arm - $14 - https://amzn.to/2Qum1bi
* Top Pick - Blue Compass - $100 - https://amzn.to/3947j11
* Top Pick - Rode PSA 1 (preferred) - $100 - https://amzn.to/33wFL3t

### Pop Filter
Everyone needs a pop filter and they are all the same (good for both all in one and standalone mics)
* Simple - Neewer $10 - https://amzn.to/2JfA2Wx
* Top - Blue - $50 https://amzn.to/2U73GmU

## Headphones:
I like a nice monitoring studio headset. They usually are made for longer sessions and nice and comfy.
* Entry - Samson SR850 - $50 - https://amzn.to/2xgNu9u
* Preferred - Sony MDR7506 - $90 - https://amzn.to/3dgW4Wy

## Webcams:
Everything is basically sold out or at crazy prices. I usually recommend the Logitech C920 as it is basic and under $40 and does a great job, but everything is crazy expensive. I would then recommend capturing a DSLR or go-pro(like i do) with a Cam Link, but they are also completely sold out.

## Lighting:
I am a huge fan of the keylight. they are expensive, but really nice with awesome control of power and temp
* Full Key Light - $180 - https://amzn.to/2J3VTQE
* Key Light Air - $130 - https://amzn.to/3dl8VHo

You can also get a series of Ring Lights that Hanselman has recommended in the past before, but I think they make your eyes look weird unless you get a large one coming from the top down.

## Desk
I love a good sit/stand desk and personally own a [Fully](https://www.fully.com/)
